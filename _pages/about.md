# About Me

I am **Ziheng Li**, a Ph.D. student at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**, focusing on data-efficient battery health prognosis under real-world constraints. My research aims to address key challenges arising from practical battery applications, including limited training samples, fragmented charging observations, and distribution discrepancies across different operating conditions and battery types.

My work centers on three methodological directions: **few-shot learning**, **generative modeling**, and **early-cycle prediction**. Specifically, I design meta-learning and domain adaptation strategies for cross-domain SOH/RUL estimation; develop generative models—such as conditional diffusion models—to reconstruct complete battery curves from partial charging segments; and build early prediction frameworks capable of assessing battery health using only partial cycle data.

The overarching goal of my research is to develop **robust, data-efficient, and deployable** battery prognostic algorithms that support electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage systems, and emerging battery technologies.

# Current Research Focus

### **Data-Constrained Battery Health Prognosis**
Real-world battery testing often suffers from limited data availability, incomplete charge-discharge cycles, and cross-domain discrepancies. To address these challenges, my research investigates:

- **Few-shot learning** for rapid adaptation under scarce data  
- **Generative diffusion models** to reconstruct full battery voltage–time curves from fragmented segments  
- **Early-cycle prediction** to achieve SOH/RUL estimation with minimal operational data  
- **Domain-invariant representation learning** to generalize across batteries, protocols, and working conditions  

These data-efficient approaches aim to reduce testing cost, enhance reliability, and accelerate battery deployment in EV and energy storage applications.
